# ECE-1310-Final-Project

Hi Scott,
If you open the .sln file in visual studio, it should run correctly. the .docx file has the plain text of the code as well as screenshots
of the inputs to test the functionality of the code. The flowchart is the picture file.

Hopefully this all works, this is my first attempt at sharing a project through github.

Thanks,
Matthew
